# Surf Shop Analysis

# Overview

We are looking to open a surf shop and ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii. We are finding the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Process:


### Deliverable 1 - Determine the Summary Statistics for June
* A query is written to retrieve all the June temperatures from the Date column in the Measurement table from the hawaii.sqlite database
* The June temperatures are added to a list
* Create a DataFrame from the list of June temperatures
* Generate summary statistics chart for the June temperatures

### Deliverable 2 - Determine the Summary Statistics for December
* A query is written to retrieve all the December temperatures from the Date column in the Measurement table from the hawaii.sqlite database
* The December temperatures are added to a list
* Create a DataFrame from the list of December temperatures
* Generate summary statistics chart for the December temperatures
